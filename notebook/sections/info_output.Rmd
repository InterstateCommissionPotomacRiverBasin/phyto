This section was created as a means of trouble shooting an issue with the scores_rating section.  It is is meant to be included in pibi_notebook in place of scores_rating.

```{r}

  metric.vec <- c("total_phyto_biomass_chla_ratio",
                  "surface_chla",
                  "cyanophyte_biomass",
                  "doc",
                  "pheophytin",
                  "total_phyto_biomass")

```

```{r}
  metrics.sub <- metrics.long %>% 
    filter(season == "spring", 
           salzone == "f",
           metric %in% metric.vec)
```


<!-- # ```{r} -->
<!-- # print(metric.vec) -->
<!-- # print(metrics.sub) -->
